    make me my toy, just as I wanted it. Was quick about it too. Now I must

This is not written in the Jester's hand, but with flowing, tight lettering.
The paper is old. This is not a new discovery.

    CHILDMAKER POTION

        Add in this exact order the following ingredients into an alchemic
        mixing bowl of a least level three:

            - 1 small drop of the liquified carcass of a dog dead on a Tuesday
            - A sprinkle of a girl's favorite perfume
            - A sqint of Naturally produced Ammoniac
            - Some drops of bottled Arrogance (Beet juice works too).
            - Another drop of carcass
            - Something from a grown child

        Notes:
            I inherited this recipe from my grandfather. He called it 'the
            potion of youth' but it's nothing as benevolent as that. In secret
            I tested it on one of the adult farmer cats to terrifying effect -
            the cat didn't rejuvinate but instead it reverted to -acting- as a
            young kitten. Worse, soon after, it had a litter of kittens of its
            own. Her kittens were not only smaller than normal, they grew only
            very slowly and also never reached full maturity or adult behavior.
            Not only does it appear the effect is permantent - it spreads
            across generations!

            This thing is -very- dangerous!  But it's my most potent mixture,
            so maybe I could use it as a base for something else. With some
            modifications, I think can turn it into some sort of FERTILIZER
            instead ...

BOOK_FERTILIZER = """
Again, this is not written by the Jester's hand, but with the same tight lettering

    I think the Childmaker could be turned into something less dangerous by
    modifying it to work for plants only. I hope to 'invert' its effects to
    instead have the plant grow fast. My biggest concern is that if the plant
    does not have enough water it will grow so fast so as to instead quickly
    become a withered and dry husk ...

        - 3 ...

The Jester writes:

    The legend of the Mute Monkey bandit is soo neat! Best thing is that he was
    real! Around here the road goes almost perfectly straight from south-west to
    north-east. No bends and still he managed to just appear out of nowhere to
    surprise travellers. He must have known the land well!

    That monkey mask fascinates me. I like monkeys, but would not a scarf be
    enough to hide your identity? It did work though - people are still scared
    of the Mute Monkey! People say he got ever more violent until the day he
    slashed a merchant's kid on the way to the village fair. I found the wanted
    poster from that time in a drawer over at Master Blochs house! I'm sure he
    won't miss it, hihi.

    Best thing with the legend was that the Monkey just ... disappeared after
    that. They never caught him. Maybe those wanted posters spooked him? Or
    maybe he returned to his lair underground, only to return in a hundred
    years, muahaha!

Written in the Jester's sprawly handwriting, this entry reads:

    I started at my cottage, expecting a great day
    For breakfast I went to the Baker, but she had lost her way.

    So I went to Anton for a quick morning bite
    And then back to my cottage to fly my kite.

    To Mrs Bullington I then went and now there was pie to eat
    I brought some to the Magus to get him on his feet.

    At Master Bloch's, a letter from the oven I freed
    I took it with me home to quietly read.

    I ended my day by looking into the Blacksmith's eyes
    And going to the Baker to help her with her pies.

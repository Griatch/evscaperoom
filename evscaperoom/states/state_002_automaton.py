The monkey automaton

This state does not need to add as much new stuff since it was all added
in the first state; rather we just need to add the new things happening
in this state.

Once the monkey has gotten its name, this moves to the next state since it will
change the room.

several of which reaches across the room just above your head. They are great
for hanging and storing things just within reach. You can see that there's
a lot of grime and dust on top of them - the Jester is really a bit of a slob.

Over the rafter closest to the *door, just over the *bed, the Jester has hung
her *laundry. On the same rafter but across the room and over the table, hangs
a series of decorative *chimes, gently swinging to and fro.

Over by the fireplace hangs what looks like a old *saddle. On top of the saddle
something is written.

    This is the situation, {name}:

    The |rJester|n wants to win your village's yearly |wpie-eating contest|n.
    As it turns out, you are one of her most dangerous opponents.

    Today, the day of the contest, she invited you to her small cabin for a
    'strategy chat'. But she tricked you and now you are |wlocked in|n! If you
    don't get out before the contest starts she'll get to eat all those pies on
    her own and surely win!

    When you get into the cabin, a *book of notes have been read and a bunch of
    disgusting ingredients have just been mixed together to create the
    so-called *childmaker potion mentioned in the book ...

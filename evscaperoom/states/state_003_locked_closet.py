    This is the situation, {name}:

    The |rJester|n wants to win your village's yearly |wpie-eating contest|n.
    As it turns out, you are one of her most dangerous opponents.

    Today, the day of the contest, she invited you to her small cabin for a
    'strategy chat'. But she tricked you and now you are |wlocked in|n! If you
    don't get out before the contest starts she'll get to eat all those pies on
    her own and surely win!

    When you get into the cabin, The monkey-statue 'Vale' has just come alive
    and walked over to the door. But he doesn't open it but instead turns around,
    waves his long arms in the air and speaks ...
"""

ROOM_DESC = """
The |rJester's cabin|n is actually just a small single room with a *door.
Ample light enters from two *windows on each side. The underside of the sloping
roof is exposed (as are the *(rafters holding them up), making the place taller
and feel more spacious than it is.

On the wall opposite the door is a small stone *fireplace, lined to the left
and right side by a tall *closet and an area acting as a *kitchen
respectively. There is also a carver *chair standing around.

Just to the right of the door is the Jester's messy *bed and to the right is
a long, empty-looking *table.

On the floor by the door is a plate on which sits a nicely smelling hintberry *pie.
*Vale has moved to stand just in front of the door, chattering to itself and
waving its arms above its head, excitedly.

In front of the door stands a strange little moving statue depicting a strange
animal with a vaguely human-like face but long arms, ears and a tail. It's
dressed in a red jacket and a conical hat. Since hobbling here on its short
legs it has started waving its hands above its head, chattering excitedly to
itself in its strange, squeaky voice.

Vale's painted monkey face is made of wood. It is too big for the body on which

after the face itself was carved.

     - but the Smith's heart grew cold and then there was only one.

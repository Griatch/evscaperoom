    My beloved Agda,

    I have written so many letters that I've then torn up. Know that I've
    always loved you in secret and that I never aimed to hurt you. But that
    doesn't change the fact that I am the reason you are the way you are today.

    You will know how happy I was when you confided in me. But after that kid
    got hurt, I just couldn't live with the secret. I laced the champion's pies
    with my potion. I am a coward, I could not think of any other way to stop
    him. How was I to know he'd lose his appetite that day of all days?

    He has been so cold to you since, but at least you are apart now. I did not
    know about your other circumstance until much later. But I understand why
    your parents had to do what they did in secret. This guilt too is on my
    shoulders, for I was the one that made you incapable of such a
    responsibility in the first place. You used to hit me out of sport, now you
    can't even raise your hand to defend yourself. It's maddening!

    I experiment with my hintberries daily to find a way to reverse your
    condition. Even if you won't love me, but continue to ridicule and mock me,
    I have no bigger wish than to see the old you return. Because then one day,
    maybe I'll forgive myself.

    Yours forever,
    Vale

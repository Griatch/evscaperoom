    This is the situation, {name}:

    The |rJester|n wants to win your village's yearly |wpie-eating contest|n.
    As it turns out, you are one of her most dangerous opponents.

    Today, the day of the contest, she invited you to her small cabin for a
    'strategy chat'. But she tricked you and now you are |wlocked in|n! If you
    don't get out before the contest starts she'll get to eat all those pies on
    her own and surely win!

    When you get into the cabin, a *lever was just inserted into the mystical
    *chest under the bed. Now, how to open it ...?

The stone slab making out the base of the fireplace is covered in
ashes. Now they are all cold though.

Among the ashes lies a small *locket that must have fallen down when turning
the damper. There is a large empty space where the *lever used to be.

LEVER_DESC = """
The metal lever is mounted in the locking mechanism of the *chest. Turning
it is not possible, but you can wiggle it up, down, left and right. Every time
you do there is a tiny 'click' from inside.

At the end of the lever facing you are clear compass markings for the
directions you can move the lever:

             (up)
            |rN|n
 (left) |yW|n       |gE|n (right)

moved from side to side. Maybe it can be turned later, once something in
the lock has changed.

happens but you think the mechanism just reset itself. Maybe ~you did something
wrong.

As ~you move the lever {direction}, there is a slightly louder click-sound from
inside the lid. That sounds promising!

    Today, the day of the contest, she invited you to her small cabin for a
    'strategy chat'. But she tricked you and now you are |wlocked in|n! If you
    don't get out before the contest starts she'll get to eat all those pies on
    her own and surely win!

    This is a matter of pride. She always does stuff like this. You can't just
    break out of here with force, that would mean she has bested you. No, being
    the trickster that she is, you are sure she has left you some way to get
    out that she can lord over you if you fail.

On the wall opposite the door is a small stone *fireplace, lined to the left

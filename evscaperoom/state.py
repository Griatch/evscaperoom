"""
States represent the sequence of states the room goes through.

This module bose includes the BaseState class and the StateHandler
for managing states on the room.

The state handler operates on an Evscaperoom and changes
its state from one to another.

A given state is given as a module in states/ package. The
state is identified by its module name.

Each such module should have these public functions (the
state handler will be calling them in sequence):

    def init_state(room) - initialize the state on the room
    def check_state(room) - figure out if the next state is reached yet, if
        so, return the name of the next state, otherwise None
    def clean_state(room) - clean up this state
